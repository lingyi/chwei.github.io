<h3>Modify Resolution of Linuxmint Guest OS on Virtualbox</h3>
<a href="https://zergl.github.io">zergl</a> 2015-02-08<br />
-------------------------<br />
By default, the resolution of guest OS, linuxmint 17.1, is 800*600. I would help after installing the additional support package based on path experiment:<br />
<pre>
# sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
</pre>
